# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-OF-U.S.-SENATORS-TWEETS
This project studies sentiment in tweets posted by U.S. senators. Senators use Twitter/X to communicate policies, react to events, and mobilize supporters. From a scientific/NLP view, tweets are short and noisy (hashtags, mentions, slang), so they are a good real-world test for sentiment analysis.
